# Welcome to the FearLess App
## A project that is currently in its early phases.
#### Ultimately the goal for the FearLess App is to design an App that will help teens and adults on the Autsim Spectrum face their fears and anxieties at a pace and in a manner that works for them. It will work best when paired with ERP (Exposure Response Therapy). 

The motivation to build this App comes from over 15 years working with multiple children, teens, and young adults on the spectrum who have OCD and/or PTSD. There is very little research and even less tools designed specifically for this group, and yet they have a great need for tools and assistance. Hopefully, if this App comes to full fruition it will be a tool this specific community can use to positive effect.

####Phase I
 Create a to-do list that I call a fear-list

####Phase II
 Make it possible to give each fear a rank of intensity

######EVENTUALLY
Build out all of the pages making it possible to assign tasks to each fear/anxiety, show progress for conquering each fear and set up a a reward system for the users.
